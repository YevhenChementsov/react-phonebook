# Forms. The component lifecycle.

- The repository `react-phonebook` is created.
- The components are rendered on the same page, inside a common container - the
  `<App>` root component.
- The component state stores the minimum required set of data, the rest is
  calculated.
- The repository header has a link to the live page on `GitHub pages`.
- When running the code, there are no errors or warnings in the console.
- There is a separate folder for each component with a React component file and
  a styles.
- There are `propTypes` and, where appropriate, `defaultProps` described for the
  components.
- Everything that the component expects in the form of props is passed to it
  when called.
- Component names are clear, descriptive.
- JS code is clean and clear, and `Prettier` is used.
- Styling is done only by `SASS`, `CSS modules`, `Styled Components` or
  `Emotion`, so the classes in the resulting DOM may differ from the examples.
- Basic styling of the application is enough, first of all it must work first,
  and then make it look pretty. Allocate 20% of your time to CSS and 80% to JS.
